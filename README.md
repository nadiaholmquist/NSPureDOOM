# NSPureDOOM

This is an implementation of [PureDOOM](https://github.com/Daivuk/PureDOOM) for macOS using Cocoa APIs written in Swift.

This was mostly just a playground for me to get a bit more familiar with macOS APIs, so don't expect good code here, or that this is actually a good way to play DOOM.
